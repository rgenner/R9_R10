## modkit_methcompare.py

This is the python script to make the split violin plot graphs comparing modkit methylation frequencies over specified intervals for R9, R10, and bisulfite sequencing data files for the HG002 cell line. These graphs were featured in ____________ paper. 

In general, this script can be used to compare interval-specific methylation frequences from three different modkit files with one of the files being used for binning. 

## Input data

The script requires three different bed or bed-like files with columns for genomic position (chromosome and start/end position), probability of the target base being modified, and coverage level of the base called.  

The violin plot in the paper was made from bedMethyl files generated by the modkit, a package for analysing ONT modified bases.  

More info about the modkit package and bedMethyl output file can be found at https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit.  

The command used to generate the modkit files used in the paper are shown below:  

```
#!/bin/bash

SAMPLE_NAME=$1
REF=$2
BAM_FILE=$2
OUT_PATH=$3

ml modkit 

modkit pileup --cpg --ref ${REF} --only-tabs --threads 24 --ignore h --combine-strands ${BAM_FILE} ${OUT_PATH}${SAMPLE_NAME}.hg38.modkit.comb.bed

#sbatch --mem=10G --cpus-per-task=25 --time=24:00:00 modkit_hg38_comb.sh SAMPLE_NAME REF BAM_FILE OUT_PATH
